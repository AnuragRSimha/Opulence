# Opulence: An Anglo-Carnatic Product
## What is Opulence?
Opulence, which in simple English means prosperity, is a simple Java-based application made employing the spring framework supoorted with a GUI built using swing.

## Why Opulence?
Imagine an idyllic restaurant ornamented in 19th Century Victorian fashion. You heartfully want to dine at this place, but you are bound to wait the advent of a waiter to your table. It's quite a squander of time awaiting his advent and place an order. Opulence is designed to address this purpose.

### The Idea
1. There would be devices mounted onto the tables in a restaurant with Opulence installed. The customers can directly take to placing an order with that device.
2. In the kitchen, there would be another device to display the captured details from the customer's end.
3. After placing the order, the table number, name, and the selected dishes/drinks would be sent to the kitchen where everything is prepared.

Although there are similar inventions in the market today, Opulence provides a secure communication between devices within restaurant premises, and keeps all data secure.

## About the logo
In the symbol, the royal crown placed atop each lion symbolises Anglo (United Kingdom). The Gandabherunda upon the crest signifies Carnatic. The sword, the boar, the moon, and the sun also imply Carnatic. Furthermore, they are the elements of the Vijayanagara Empire, an utterly wealthy kingdom from Karnataka, South India. All in all, they collectively signify opulence. Henceforth, Opulence: An Anglo-Carnatic Product.
